The global equity markets woke up to a sea of red this week, but this wasn't driven by interest rates or geopolitical tension. It was driven by code.

Specifically, the release of **Claude Code** and its rapid proliferation of specialized **"Skills"** has forced institutional investors to fundamentally re-evaluate the terminal value of the entire B2B software sector.

## The Event: "Skills" Replacing "Apps"

For the past decade, the investment thesis was simple: Software eats the world. You buy the SaaS leaders (Salesforce, Adobe, Atlassian) because they own the *workflow*.

The release of Claude Code destroys this moat. By allowing AI agents to seamlessly "install" skills—specialized, headless capabilities that execute tasks without a user interface—the value proposition of a clunky, subscription-based web interface collapses.

Why pay $30/user/ month for a project management tool when an agent with a `project-manager` skill can organize your GitHub issues, update your roadmap, and slack your team automatically, for a fraction of the inference cost?

## The Market Reaction: A Deflationary Crash

The market is currently pricing in **"AI Deflation"**:

1.  **DevTools Massacre**: Companies that sell "seats" to developers are plummeting. If one senior engineer + Claude Code = 10 engineers, seat counts (and revenue) will drop 90%.
2.  **Service Sector Shorting**: IT consulting firms (Accenture, Infosys) are seeing their order books questioned. Why hire an outsourcing firm when you can spawn 50 agentic workers overnight?
3.  **The "Interface Premium" Evaporates**: Stocks that relied on "sticky UIs" are being dumped. In an agentic world, the UI is just a hindrance. The value is in the **Data** and the **Model**, not the Interface.

## Where Capital Flows Next

While the NASDAQ corrects, we are seeing a violent rotation into:

*   **Compute & Infra**: The "Skills" economy is compute-hungry. NVIDIA and cloud hyperscalers are the utilities of this new world.
*   **Proprietary Data Owners**: Agents need context. Companies with unique, undigitized data (medical records, specialized legal archives) become gold mines.
*   **Physical World Anchors**: Robots, logistics, and manufacturing—things AI code cannot purely hallucinate into existence.

## Conclusion

We are witnessing the death of the "App Economy" and the birth of the "Skill Economy." The sell-off is painful, but it is rational. The market is realizing that 80% of today's software features are about to become zero-marginal-cost commodities.
